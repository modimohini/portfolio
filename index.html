                I am a friendly personality with ease to operate in a collaborative, progressive work environment. I like to understand the business requirements and challenging problems, enhance application performance, and use monitoring-alerting tools like SPLUNK, AppDynamics, MS SQL, MongoDB for CRUD operations and deployments a prod non-prod environment.
